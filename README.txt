To compile the program, a Makefile is provided. Simply type make! There is also a make clean command to remove the executable and object files.
This program prints the rights a user or group (specified by -g) has over a file or directory. 
There is a printError function that prints various errors (invalid username or groupname, UID or GID overflow, etc.) and exits.
